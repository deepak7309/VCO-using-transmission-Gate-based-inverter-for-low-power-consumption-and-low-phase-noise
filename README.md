# VCO-using-transmission-Gate-based-inverter-for-low-power-consumption-and-low-phase-noise in Cadence Virtuoso 
Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCOs) serve as fundamental building blocks in various electronic systems, ranging from communication devices to frequency synthesizers. The demand for VCOs with low power consumption and low phase noise characteristics has grown significantly, especially with the proliferation of battery-operated and portable devices. In response to this demand, innovative circuit design techniques have emerged to address these requirements effectively.

One such technique involves leveraging transmission gate-based inverters and delay cells in VCO design. This approach offers several advantages over traditional designs, including improved power efficiency and reduced phase noise. By utilizing transmission gates, which provide lower resistance and capacitance compared to conventional CMOS inverters, along with carefully designed delay cells, it becomes possible to achieve a VCO with enhanced performance metrics.

In this paper, we explore the design and implementation of a VCO using a transmission gate-based inverter architecture combined with delay cells. We investigate the theoretical principles underlying this approach and discuss its advantages in terms of power consumption and phase noise performance. Additionally, we present simulation results and discuss practical considerations for realizing such a VCO in integrated circuit technology. Overall, this research aims to contribute to the development of energy-efficient and high-performance VCOs for modern electronic applications.
